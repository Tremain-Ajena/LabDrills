            <p>I typically have a hard time understanding a concept the first time it's introduced to me, so I always repeat and retry the material until I finally understand it.</p>

        <h2>Oodles of Noodles</h2>
            <p>I think Maruchan brand ramen noodles are the top shelf of cuisine and Nissin Top Ramen is trash.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maruchan Chicken Flavored Ramen Noodles = The Bentley of Cuisine</li>
                <li>There is no in-between. There's only one or the other!</li>
                <li>Any Nissin Brand Noodle Flavor = The Tesla Truck of Cuisine = GTA 3 Visual Design = Hot Dumpster Juice</li>

            <li>Dogs are my favorite, but I hate when they run, jump, bark, and drool</li>
